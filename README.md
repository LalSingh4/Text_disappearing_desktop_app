Disappearing Text Desktop Application 

The app is simple to use. The user will start writing whatever he wants to write. 
If he takes a pause for 5 seconds, the text he has written is deleted. 
The user can even save his text in a text file,
although, he will need to click on the save button within 5 seconds after he stops typing. 
This app can be used to practice typing fast, and not taking long pauses.
